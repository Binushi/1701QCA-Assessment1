*Fill out the following workbook with information relevant to your project.*

*Markdown reference:* [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](http://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## Replication project choice ##
(Insert the name of the project you chose to replicate.)

## Related projects ##
*Find about 6 related projects to the project you choose. A project might be related through  function, technology, materials, fabrication, concept, or code. Don't forget to place an image of the related project in the* `replicationproject` *folder and insert the filename in the appropriate places below. Copy the markdown block of code below for each project you are showing, updating the number* `1` *in the subtitle for each.*

### Related project 1 ###
(Artiphon INSTRUMENT 1)

This is releeated to my project beacuse, it is using different actions to manipulate sound.

### Related project 2 ###
(Reactable)

(https://reactable.com/)

This project is related to mine because, simmilarly to the prevouse one it is using different actions to manipulate sound. This one also includes elements that allow it to be more toy like.

### Related project 3 ###
(Seaboard RISE)

This project also allow to to manliplate sound with interactions. This poject also allows to record sound, this could be i could extent my project.

### Related project 4 ###
(AlphaSphere)

(https://alphasphere.com/)

This project also allow to to manliplate sound with action but in a really unusual way. The ball shape creates many ways to interect with it. It has be designed to the user will learn new and interesting ways to use the project. This could be somthing for me to incoperate in my project. It also has IPhone connectivity, that could be a further way to extend mt project.

### Related project 5 ###
(Jambé)

This project is a drum vertion of my project.The Jambé is a multi-faceted pad that is capable of reproducing several unique percussion sounds.

This project also allow to to manliplate sound with interactions. This poject also allows to record sound and has IPhone connectivity, this could be i could extent my project. this project shows how i could develop my project designed as a childerens toy coud be developed and created to adult usses.

## Reading reflections ##
*Reflective reading is an important part of actually making your reading worthwhile. Don't just read the words to understand what they say: read to see how the ideas in the text fit with and potentially change your existing knowledge and maybe even conceptual frameworks. We assume you can basically figure out what the readings mean, but the more important process is to understand how that changes what you think, particularly in the context of your project.*

*For each of the assigned readings, answer the questions below.*

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

*Before this reading I had no idea, what affordances were. This reading helped understand what affordances are and brought to my attention the amount of thought that goes into simple things. The reading helped me see simple design elements can have a huge impact. For example, the sink, although the action of pressing the cap of the drain is simple, people don’t think of that as a first instinct and also your clean hands have to touch the dirty water to turn drain the water. I can apply the ideas from this reading to my project, I need to make sure my design is useable for everyone, and make sure that my first instinct on how to use it is the same as other peoples. I can do this by asking other people to use it without any instructions. I also need to look into the affordances my project supplies. A question I have from the reading is what can be changed to make affordances easier to understand.*



### Reading: Chapter 1 of Dan Saffer, Microinteractions: Designing with Details, Chapter 1 ###

*Before this reading I believed that micro interactions did not hugely affect an overall product/ application. This reading has brought the impotence of micro interactions to my attention.  Now I can see how much of a difference micro interaction make. I can also now see how much I use micro interactions in a day without even knowing. I can incorporate this into my project. Having good micro interaction can improve my overall useability. One question I have after this reading is what would happen if some of there micro interaction were changed, for example if toasters did multiple things not just toast would this effect the toaster in a positive or negative way. Would it increase useability or not.   *



### Reading: Scott Sullivan, Prototyping Interactive Objects ###

*Before this reading I was not clear on the difference between designer and developer. Now I know that the designer makes make nontechnical decisions whereas the developer implement those decisions. This reading also helped me see the importance of prototyping and how it can help to see any issues. This can be used in my project. One question I have after this reading was are there different ways of creating prototypes. *




## Interaction flowchart ##
*Draw a flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Process documentation

*In this section, include text and images that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.*

*This should have quite a lot of information!*

*There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. Use the code below to include images, and copy it for each image, updating the information for each.*

*Include screenshots of the code you have used.*

## Project outcome ##

*Complete the following information.*

### Project title ###
* Saxaphone *

### Project description ###

*My Project is based of the micro bit Guitar project but has been adapted to be a saxophone. The Saxophone has been designed to play different notes depending on the angle the saxophone is held at, the amount of light the micro bit and if the user is touching a pin. I have designed this to be a children’s toy as it is simple but can provide a lot of entertainment for a child.*

### Showcase image ###

*Try to capture the image as if it were in a portfolio, sales material, or project proposal. The project isn't likely to be something that finished, but practice making images that capture the project in that style.*

### Additional view ###

*Provide some other image that gives a viewer a different perspective on the project such as more about how it functions, the project in use, or something else.*

### Reflection ###

*Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.*


*What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?*


*What ideas have you read, heard, or seen that informed your thinking on this project? (Provide references.)*


*What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used?*
